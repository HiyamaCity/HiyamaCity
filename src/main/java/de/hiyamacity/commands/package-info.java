/**
 * This package contains all the Commands for the Server.
 * <p>
 * They are split into two major packages <code>admin</code> and <code>user</code>.
 * In essence the <code>admin</code> package holds all the commands that need special permissions
 * even if they are not "admin only" on the other hand we have the <code>user</code> package
 * which contains all the commands that can be run by anyone.
